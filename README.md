## Project Description
Promotify is a "productivity" app that actively encourages procrastination, celebrates failure, and helps you make questionably bad life decisions - because sometimes being unproductive is the most productive thing you can do!

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are way too motivated and productive these days! They actually complete their tasks on time, make sensible life decisions, and have healthy relationships. This is clearly a crisis that needs immediate attention. Where's the fun in being responsible?

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've created an anti-productivity app that:
- Sends demotivating quotes when you add tasks
- Celebrates when you miss deadlines with encouraging failure messages
- Shows terrible compatibility scores (unless you hate someone, then it's perfect!)
- Generates absurd life decisions like "Adopt 47 cats and name them all Steve"
- Includes a game where the only rule is DON'T do something (and you'll probably fail at that too) and also waste your time
